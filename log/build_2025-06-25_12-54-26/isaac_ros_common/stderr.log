[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvpi.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "vpi", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "vpi" with any of
  the following names:

    vpiConfig.cmake
    vpi-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "vpi" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "vpi_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "vpi" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
